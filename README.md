## Overview

WashHub is a customer service representative (CSR) portal developed as a part of a membership and loyalty platform for car wash services. This portal is designed to enhance the efficiency of CSRs in supporting customers who come up with queries or issues.

Typically, a CSR will encounter questions such as:
- "I want to cancel my account."
- "I have a question about a recent purchase."
- "I purchased a new vehicle and I want my subscription transferred."
- "I am not able to get a wash" (usually due to their account being in an "overdue" status resulting from a failed membership payment).

This platform allows customers to sign up for subscription-based monthly memberships, purchase single washes, update their payment information, redeem coupons, and manage their accounts. The project provides a complete solution to manage these queries effectively.
